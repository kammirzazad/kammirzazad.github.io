<p>Hey there, Iâ€™m Kamyar.</p>
<p>
I have been pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of The University of Texas at Austin since Fall 2015. On my way to doctorate, I earned my Master of Science in Engineering degree in Fall 2017. 
I am in Architecture, Computer Systems and Embedded Systems (ACSES) track and a member of the <a class="simple" href="https://slam.ece.utexas.edu">System-Level Architecture and Modeling (SLAM) Research Group</a>.
</p>
<p>
My research at UT has mostly been focused on <b>distributed real-time streaming IoT applications</b>. 
IoT often utilizes open public networks for communication between devices, which cannot provide timing guarantees for reliable delivery. 
To enable static analysis and modeling of these applications, we are proposing extensions to data flow models that capture network losses and delays, tools to analyze these models and runtime systems for deployment of such applications. 
We are using network simulators and a cluster of development boards to develop and verify our models and runtime systems.
This work is part of the <a class="simple" href="http://slam.ece.utexas.edu/projects/NoS.html">Network-Level Design of Cyber-Physical Networks-of-Systems</a> project at SLAM Lab.
</p>
<p> Prior to joining UT, I got my Bachelor of Science in Eletrical Engineering (Digital Systems track) from <a class="simple" href="https://sharif.edu"> Sharif University of Technology</a>. As my senior design project, I worked on improving the accuracy of throughput estimation of streaming applications for a given buffer size allocation. I also got a minor degree in Computer Engineering while I was in Sharif.</p>
<p> As any other computer engineer, I enjoy programming in multiple low and high level languages. You can view some of my work in my GitHub.</p>
