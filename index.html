At its core, research in <b>System-Level Architecture and Modeling (SLAM)</b> has traditionally been concerned with electronic system-level design (ESL/SLD) of embedded computer systems, where a specific focus has been on system-level design automation methodologies, technologies and tools. Many results continue to flow into the development of the System-on-Chip Design Enviroment (SCE), which realizes an automated design flow for synthesis of high-level system specifications down to highly heterogeneous multi-processor and multi-core systems-on-chip (MPCSoCs) spanning across hardware and software boundaries. A commercial derivate of SCE, called called SER (Specify-Explore-Refine), has been developed and deployed for use in suppliers of space-electronic components for the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Both SCE and SER are based on the SpecC system-level design language (SLDL), which has been cited as major reference for the development of SystemC, the leading, industry-standard SLDL today. We use both languages in our group.
